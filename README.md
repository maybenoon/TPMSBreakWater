This repository contains an OpenFOAM case (WaveGen) set up to simulate a piston-type wave generator and wave interaction using olaFlow(OpenFOAM-based solver for free-surface flows)

Features
- Based on OpenFOAM v7 with olaFlow
- Uses a piston wavemaker defined via pistonWaveGen.py
- Generates mesh using snappyHexMesh

Requirements
- OpenFOAM v7 with olaFlow installed
- Python 3 with numpy
